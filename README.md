Advanced Java Laboratory Syllabus - VTU
This repository contains the syllabus, lab exercises, and resources for the Advanced Java Laboratory course designed for VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) students.

Objective
The goal of this course is to introduce students to advanced Java programming concepts, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), multithreading, JavaFX for GUI applications, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and other modern Java features.

Labs Overview
Each lab is designed to provide practical exposure to Java programming. The exercises aim to develop students' problem-solving abilities and deepen their understanding of core Java concepts. Students will explore topics such as collections, exception handling, multithreading, database interaction, GUI development, and more.

Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:

Labs: Each lab is documented with the objectives, key topics covered, and coding exercises.

Resources: This section includes additional materials like textbooks, tutorials, and sample code to help students with their learning journey.

The labs focus on real-world Java programming challenges, helping students strengthen their programming skills and better prepare for advanced Java applications. The exercises are designed to be hands-on, ensuring that students gain valuable experience in applying Java concepts to solve practical problems.

Resources
This repository also contains various learning materials:

Books: Textbooks and PDFs for in-depth study.

Tutorials: Helpful guides and online resources for learning advanced Java.

Sample Code: Example code and solutions for each lab to aid understanding and practice.
